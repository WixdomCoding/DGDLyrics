        <p>
            I followed, making flirty faces, rounding out the bases<br>
            So you'd borrow me for the night, maybe for life, whoa<br>
            Endorphin orphan morphing, lemon cheese equally<br>
            You know my origin story, born in the cemetery<br>
            I'm into stupid apps, like 'cry-yo-own self back to sleep'<br>
            My rock is solidbucks, these people ameniti-ties<br>
            Must have you misunderstood, little girl, you're a dangerous lady<br>
            Just because it feels so good, that don't make<br>
            That don't make you my baby<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tillian]<br>
            Fed me Skittles on a burial ground<br>
            Gave me rabies in the back of my car<br>
            Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Jon Mess Tilian, Jon Mess & Will Swan]<br>
            Get another round of weirdo in 'em<br>
            Turn around slow and rear your head<br>
            No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br><br>
          
            [Verse 2: Tillian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Only on occasion do I lose my patience<br>
            I just swallow all of my pride, but I can't this time, oh<br>
            I test this cable, I plugged into a tree<br>
            I play the tokin' tone from straight off the leaf<br>
            I got the smoothest roots that spew out the feet<br>
            There's a clue in a plant and it can bite off the teeth of disease<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tillian]<br>
            Fed me Skittles on a burial ground<br>
            Gave me rabies in the back of my car<br>
            Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br>
            Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian, Jon Mess & Will Swan]<br>
            Get another round of weirdo in 'em<br>
            Turn around slow and rear your head<br>
            No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Now you're just another scar<br><br>

            [Outro: Jon Mess & Will Swan, Tilian]<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            (You're just another)<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Kiss your ass goodbye<br>
            Just a little scar tissue in the back of my heart<br><br>
