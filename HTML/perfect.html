                    <p>
            [Verse 1]<br>
            Start out as something beautiful<br>
            Hold out for something unreal<br>
            But don't hold your breath<br>
            Because I'm all that's left<br>
            Say that I've gone<br>
            So you walk away<br><br>

            [Chorus]<br>
            Well, I was once willing to admit you're perfect<br>
            But now the words they stutter off my lips<br>
            Well, I was once willing to admit<br>
            You were perfect, perfect<br><br>

            [Verse 2]<br>
            And all my dreams<br>
            Hold out on my knees<br>
            Hold out, I'm all in<br>
            I can't bet, I can't win<br>
            Save it all for the end<br><br>

            [Verse 3]<br>
            Hey, and now<br>
            Let's all pretend you didn't want to go down<br>
            Hey now<br>
            Let's all pretend<br>
            Save it all<br>
            Pretend you didn't want to go down<br>
            Hey now<br>
            Let's all pretend<br><br>
          
            [Chorus]<br>
            Well I was once willing to admit you're perfect<br>
            But now the words they stutter off my lips<br>
            Well I was once willing to admit<br>
            You were perfect, perfect<br>
