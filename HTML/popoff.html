            [Intro: Jon Mess]<br>
            Ball cupping, make you stare<br>
            Of course, all this shit isn't fair (I don't care)<br>
            I'm cummin' everywhere<br>
            Of course, all this shit isn't fair (I don't care)<br><br>
            
            [Refrain 1: Jon Mess & Andrew Wells]<br>
            Pop off, I took the top off<br>
            You took the vintage authentic and made it knock-off<br>
            Then you add it to your recipe<br>
            It's not H-E-L-P-I-N-G S-H-I-T<br><br>
            
            [Verse 1: Tilian]<br>
            You want my time off, you want it all though<br>
            You got your claws out in cherry red tone<br>
            Perfectly shaded to get me persuaded to your demands<br>
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br>
            You got me wound up, don't wanna come down<br>
            Can feel the tension, a ticking time bomb<br>
            Minutes to seconds until all the lessons<br>
            I've learned become ravaged and spent<br><br>
            
            [Refrain 2: Tilian]<br>
            You're all that I want<br>
            You're not what I need but I have to succumb<br>
            You're all that I want, oh-oh<br>
            But I know that this all ends in bad blood<br>
           
            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You think you're superior<br>
            Everyone's a threat, there's bad blood<br>
            Always bad blood, yeah<br>
            You're territorial<br>
            Everywhere you go there's bad blood<br>
            Always bad blood, yeah<br><br>
            
            [Refrain 1: Jon Mess & Andrew Wells]<br>
            Pop off, I took the top off<br>
            You took the vintage authentic and made it knock-off<br>
            Then you add it to your recipe<br>
            It's not H-E-L-P-I-N-G S-H-I-T<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2: Tilian]<br>
            Gave you my passion, you took it all though<br>
            Elegant fangs out covered in crimson<br>
            Always delighted when I'm drowning in helpless obsession<br>
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br>
            You got me bound up, ignoring phone calls<br>
            Dissolving friendships for your affection<br>
            Dwindle my reach until you're what I need<br>
            To relieve me of all of my dreams<br><br>
            
            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You think you're superior<br>
            Everyone's a threat, there's bad blood<br>
            Always bad blood, yeah<br>
            You're territorial<br>
            Everywhere you go there's bad blood<br>
            Always bad blood, yeah<br>
            [Bridge: Jon Mess]<br>
            I think you need a friend<br>
            I think you need aâ€”<br>
            Give a pet a home<br>
            They won't leave you, no<br>
            Pull lever, you can never find a better bro<br>
            Give a pet a home<br>
            They won't leave you, no<br><br>
            
            [Refrain 2: Tilian]<br>
            You're all that I want<br>
            You're not what I need but I have to succumb<br>
            You're all that I want<br>
            But this all ends in bad<br>
            All ends in bad blood<br><br>
            
            [Outro: Jon Mess]<br>
            Dog digging in the plants, these relationships<br>
            They just can't understand<br>
            Ask what do they do, what they do for you<br>
            That's my best fucking friend  <br><br>
