                    <p>
            How, how could we forget about you?<br>
            The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood<br>
            Of all the iterations, yeah, you're the sickest dude<br>
            Fighting cow, how could we forget about you?<br><br>

            [Verse 1: Tilian]<br>
            Say you don't hate me for nothing<br>
            Hate me for falling out of reach<br>
            Hate me for something<br>
            Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely<br>
            Running out of feelings, so pretend you can be lonely, lonely<br>
            Stuck in your mind<br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Can't let it go<br>
            What hurts you the most<br>
            Is I wasn't there to beg you<br>
            "Baby, don't go"<br>
            Put on a show<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Light it up, light it up<br>
            No, it's not a phase<br>
            It's the way that she combs my hair<br>
            Never wake, never wake from this coma<br><br>
          
            [Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]<br>
            How, how could we forget about you?<br>
            The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood<br>
            Of all the iterations, yeah, you're the sickest dude<br>
            Fighting cow, how could we forget about you?<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Light it up for us, show me the way you're growing<br>
            Your catharsis is beautiful, I wish I could be you<br><br>

            Show up at the ball wit yo doo-doo faced babe<br>
            The robot with human hair is dead, but gets laid<br>
            That's why he's got all these kids on the way<br>
            His son's a girl named Baby Swirl that loves to swang his blade<br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Can't let it go<br>
            What hurts you the most<br>
            Is I wasn't there to beg you<br>
            "Baby, don't go"<br>
            Put on a show<br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Light it up, light it up<br>
            No, it's not a phase<br>
            It's the way that she combs my hair<br>
            Never wake, never wake from this coma<br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

            [Outro: Tilian]<br>
            Light it up for us, show me the way you're growing<br>
            Your catharsis is beautiful<br>
            Brighter<br>
            How I wish I could touch you<br>
            Feel you, breathe you, be just like you<br>
