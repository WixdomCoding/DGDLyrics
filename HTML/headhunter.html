            [Intro: Jon Mess]<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br><br>

            [Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            Simple angel, perfect devil<br>
            Can I come inside?<br>
            I'm feeling like larva<br>
            I'm frumpy like Martha<br>
            A 15-foot Parka<br>
            I grow out my clothes<br>
            Eat till I'm sleepy<br>
            The muffins are beefy<br>
            A giant diamond<br>
            When you're blessed, it shows<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You wanted me to act up<br>
            To make you feel more backed up<br>
            Well, take a swig of vodka<br>
            And battle underwater<br>
            You say you need a father<br>
            Well, baby, I'm a baller<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

            [Refrain: Jon Mess]<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Tilian]<br>
            No rehash, no rehab<br>
            No empty simulation<br>
            I want it, I made it<br>
            It's not an animation<br>
            Got no time for depression<br>
            No therapy session<br>
            Inertia, it festers<br>
            And feeds my aggression<br>
            These chains on my tires<br>
            They came with it, they're stock<br>
            My sense of direction is all the way up, up<br><br>

            [Bridge: Tilian]<br>
            Keep up, keep up 'cause I'm not coming down<br>
            I'm jacking up shots, you can fight for the rebound<br>
            Got an angel and a devil seducing my head<br>
            I'm in for a three-way I'll sleep when I'm dead<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You wanted me to act up<br>
            To make you feel more backed up<br>
            Well, take a swig of vodka<br>
            And battle underwater<br>
            You say you need a father<br>
            Well, baby, I'm a baller<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

            [Outro: Tilian]<br>
            Na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na<br>
