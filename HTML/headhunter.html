            [Intro: Jon Mess]<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br><br>

            [Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            Simple angel, perfect devil<br>
            Can I come inside?<br>
            I'm feeling like larva<br>
            I'm frumpy like Martha<br>
            A 15-foot Parka<br>
            I grow out my clothes<br>
            Eat till I'm sleepy<br>
            The muffins are beefy<br>
            A giant diamond<br>
            When you're blessed, it shows<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You wanted me to act up<br>
            To make you feel more backed up<br>
            Well, take a swig of vodka<br>
            And battle underwater<br>
            You say you need a father<br>
            Well, baby, I'm a baller<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

            [Refrain: Jon Mess]<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br>
            B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S<br>
            Will you bless this mess?<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Tilian]<br>
            No rehash, no rehab<br>
            No empty simulation<br>
            I want it, I made it<br>
            It's not an animation<br>
            Got no time for depression<br>
            No therapy session<br>
            Inertia, it festers<br>
            And feeds my aggression<br>
            These chains on my tires<br>
            They came with it, they're stock<br>
            My sense of direction is all the way up, up<br><br>

            [Bridge: Tilian]<br>
            Keep up, keep up 'cause I'm not coming down<br>
            I'm jacking up shots, you can fight for the rebound<br>
            Got an angel and a devil seducing my head<br>
            I'm in for a three-way I'll sleep when I'm dead<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            You wanted me to act up<br>
            To make you feel more backed up<br>
            Well, take a swig of vodka<br>
            And battle underwater<br>
            You say you need a father<br>
            Well, baby, I'm a baller<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br>
            I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

            [Outro: Tilian]<br>
            Na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na<br>
            Na-na, na-na-na-na<br>

        <h2>Head Hunter</h2>
        <h3>Produced by Kris Crummett</h3>
        <h4>About the Song:</h4>
        <p>“Head Hunter” is Dance Gavin Dance’s first single since the release of Artificial Selection in 2018. The track was released alongside a music video directed by Samuel Halleen, who worked on the band’s popular hits like “Midnight Crusade”, “Betrayed by the Game” and “Inspire The Liars”.
<br><br>
            The lyrics seem to describe Jon Mess and his ascension to a godlike status, and Tillian seems to be making an attempt to swoon a lady
        <br><br>    
            This is the first installment of what would become a duology with the track “Blood Wolf”, since both the artworks can be put together in order to complete a picture.</p>
