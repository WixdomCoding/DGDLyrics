            [Refrain: Tilian]<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo<br><br>
            
            [Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling<br>
            She's living, she's golden, she lives for me<br>
            Says she lives for me<br>
            Ovation, her own motivation<br>
            She comes 'round and she goes down on me<br>
            And I make her smile like a drug for you<br>
            Do ever what you want to do, coming over you<br>
            Keep on smiling what we go through<br>
            One stop to the rhythm that divides you<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse<br>
            Chop another line like a coda with a curse<br>
            Come on like a freak show, takes the stage<br>
            We give them the games we play, she said<br><br>
            
            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I want something else<br>
            To get me through this<br>
            Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby<br>
            I want something else<br>
            I'm not listening when you say<br>
            Goodbye<br><br>
            
            [Refrain: Tilian]<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2: Jon Mess]<br>
            The sky was gold, it was rose<br>
            I was taking sips of it through my nose<br>
            And I wish I could get back there, some place back there<br>
            Smiling in the pictures you would take<br>
            Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break<br>
            It won't stop, I won't come down<br>
            I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop<br>
            And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given<br>
            Then I bumped again, then I bumped again<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            How do I get back there<br>
            To the place where I fell asleep inside you?<br>
            How do I get myself back to the place<br>
            Where you said?<br><br>
            
            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I want something else<br>
            To get me through this<br>
            Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby<br>
            I want something else<br>
            I'm not listening when you say<br>
            Goodbye<br><br>

            [Verse 3: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            I believe in the sand beneath my toes<br>
            The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling<br>
            I believe in the faith that grows<br>
            And the four right chords can make me cry<br>
            When I'm with you I feel like I could die<br>
            And that would be all right, all right<br>
            When the plane came in<br>
            She said she was crashing<br>
            The velvet it rips in the city<br>
            We tripped on the urge to feel alive<br>
            But now I'm struggling to surrender<br>
            Those days you were wearing that velvet dress<br>
            You're the priestess I must confess<br>
            Those little red panties, they pass the test<br>
            Slide up around the belly face<br>
            Down on the mattress one<br><br>
            
            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I want something else<br>
            To get me through this<br>
            Life, baby<br>
            I want something else<br>
            Not listening when you say<br>
            Goodbye<br>
            Goodbye<br>
            Goodbye<br>
            Goodbye<br>
            Goodbye<br><br>

            [Refrain: Tilian]<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br><br>
            
            [Outro: Jon Mess]<br>
            The sky was gold, it was rose<br>
            I was taking sips of it through my nose<br>
            And I wish I could get back there, some place back there<br>
            In the place we would start out lives<br>
            
            [Refrain: Tilian]<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo<br>
            (I want something else) <br><br>
