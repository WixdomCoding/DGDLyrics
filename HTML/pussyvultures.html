                    <p>
            [Refrain: Tillian]<br>
            Nostalgia, we used to lose ourselves in conversation<br>
            Nothing was final, we used to brace ourselves for separation<br>
            From time to time I find myself wondering what could be<br>
            If I'd never been to hell before I built a shell<br><br>

            [Chorus: Jon Mess]<br>
            The pussy vultures are coming for your girlfriend after you break up<br>
            They listen to her sad story then slip it in when she's vulnerable<br>
            Don't think it won't happen to you<br>
            My best friend said, "Hey Jon, screw you"<br>
            Now I'm confused, I don't know what to do<br>
            So don't think it won't happen, it won't happen to you<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Can't send a postcard<br>
            From the future to the past<br>
            Can't warn your own self<br>
            That these memories fade too fast<br>
            And when it's over<br>
            You can't recreate the past<br>
            My mind is an ocean<br>
            Wish I built a bigger raft<br><br>

            [Verse: Tillian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Stuck inside all these distant memories<br>
            Was supposed to start a family with you<br>
            I keep trying to hold it all in my head<br>
            Convince myself that I still love you<br>
            But you're never coming back<br>
            And this pain is all I have to hold you<br>
            And it's fading out too fast<br>
            And I can't make it last anymore<br><br>
           
            [Bridge: Jon Mess, Tilian]<br>
            Until I can't crave it at all<br>
            Until I can't forget it existed<br>
            Until I can't crave it at all<br>
            Until I can't forget it existed<br>
            Impossible to say, just how long we'll be waiting<br>
            We'll hide it all away, to keep our love from running out, out, out<br><br>

            [Refrain: Tillian]<br>
            Nostalgia, we used to lose ourselves in conversation<br>
            Nothing was final, we used to brace ourselves for separation<br><br>

            The pussy vultures are coming for your girlfriend after you break up<br>
            They listen to her sad story then slip it in when she's vulnerable<br>

            Now I'm confused, I don't know what to do<br>
