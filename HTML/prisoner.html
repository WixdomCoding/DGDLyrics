                    <p>
            [Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            Do you crave a greater reason to exist?<br>
            Have you always known that symmetry is bliss?<br>
            We know you see the pattern<br>
            Lay in your lap, think of your path<br>
            Philosophy don't bother me, come back when you're trash<br>
            You are welcome here but you must come alone<br>
            You know everything is everywhere is home<br>
            Do you see it?<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Prisoner, prisoner<br>
            We found you<br>
            We feel you breathing<br>
            Are you there?<br>
            Can you hear us calling you?<br>
            We'll never judge you<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tillian]<br>
            Run out of battery<br>
            Learn how to patronize<br>
            You gotta obtain, sustain, that guy<br>
            No time to make a deal today<br>
            We just push that other guy outta the way<br>
            Nothing's in a vacuum<br>
            Space-time has no value<br>
            We're all connected on this wave<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Prisoner, prisoner<br>
            We found you<br>
            We feel you breathing<br>
            Are you there?<br>
            Can you hear us calling you?<br>
            We'll never judge you<br><br>

            [Bridge: Jon Mess]<br>
            They spoke with potent pain<br>
            To all that's broken<br>
            To tears in rain<br>
            But every side was the same<br>
            No coin to flip<br><br>

            [Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]<br>
            Give yourself a medal, you just met the devil<br>
            You're the last in the world to find another false god<br>
            Give yourself a medal for dancing with the devil<br>
            You're the last in the world<br>
            Come back down to crippling doubt<br>
            Well, Billy backs abortion and eye cream<br>
            Smokes a pack of Christian Bale and fucks on an island<br>
            Well, smooth as oscillation of sine waves<br>
            Get off the high horse and fly the spy plane<br>
            Classic acid, put me back in the casket<br>
            Weave me into the fabric<br>
            The filter is freaking out<br>

        <h2>Prisoner</h2>
        <h3>Produced by Drew Fulk & Kris Crummett</h3>
        <h3>Featuring Sergio Medina</h3>
        <h4>About the Song:</h4>
        <p>“Prisoner” describes a hallucinogenic trip and the thoughts associated with that drug experience. This idea is backed by the psychodelic visuals of the music video directed by Orie McGinness.
<br><br>
            This is the lead single and opening track of Dance Gavin Dance’s ninth full-length album Afterburner. The song features guitarist Sergio Medina, from Stolas, Sianvar, Royal Coda, and Nova Charisma.</p>
