                <b>Our Story</b>
                
            <p>The Dance Gavin Dance lyrics project was born out of a deep passion for the band's music and a desire to provide an easy, accessible way for fans to enjoy and connect with their lyrics. The brainchild behind this endeavor is none other than Wixdom, a dedicated fan and web enthusiast who crafted this site in their spare time.
                
                Wixdom's journey with Dance Gavin Dance began years ago, sparked by the band's unique blend of post-hardcore, progressive rock, and experimental elements. As a fan, Wixdom felt a strong connection to the band's lyrics, which often touch on deeply personal and relatable themes. However, there was a noticeable gap in the availability of easily accessible lyrics for fans like themselves.
                
                With a passion for web development and a love for Dance Gavin Dance, Wixdom decided to take matters into their own hands. They embarked on a mission to create a platform that would provide fans with lyrics for every song in the band's expansive discography. The result is the Dance Gavin Dance lyrics project, a labor of love that aims to enhance your experience as a DGD enthusiast.</p>
