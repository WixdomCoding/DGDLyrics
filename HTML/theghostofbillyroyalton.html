        <p>[Verse 1: Jon Mess]<br>
            I'm drowning in blue light<br>
            It's a new knife<br>
            In a three-legged pant<br>
            I have no qualities so don't talk to me<br>
            I'm in love with that plant<br>
            Now I can be too nice<br>
            I could do right<br>
            I can bust out a rant<br>
            I still hate the game<br>
            But I'll say the name<br>
            It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br>
            It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br>
            It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br><br>
            
            [Refrain: Tilian, Andrew Wells]<br>
            Putting all your faith in lies<br>
            I've been facing endless trials<br>
            Numbered all your days in kind<br>
            Days in kind<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Try and stop me<br>
            Banking on the fragments of my shadow (Of my shadow)<br>
            Dropping off excuses on the way<br>

            [Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Thank God I know the road back home<br>
            You're a battered thief in the night<br>
            At best you'rе a parasite (Oh-oh)<br>
            Thank God I know the road back home<br>
            (Evеrybody come 'cause the Lord got in me)<br>
            (Put me on the board of the soul shine company)<br>
            You're an outed spook with a knife<br>
            (Everybody poor 'til the heart start opening up)<br>
            Go ahead, wallow in your spite<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2: Jon Mess]<br>
            Let's clap for healing and feeling<br>
            Alleviate pain<br>
            I'm looking in the truth of it<br>
            The root of it<br>
            Stop dragging my wings<br>
            I fear I'm not enough or I'm too much<br>
            Keep scrubbing that stain<br>
            I'm responsible, it's possible<br>
            Let it process and drain<br><br>
            
            [Verse 3: Will Swan]<br>
            What about that Skywalker OG<br>
            JP3, Alan?<br>
            Put bass down, I'll write around it<br>
            That trust just comes with the talent<br>
            Some things you can't replace<br>
            Hurt yourself if you even try it<br>
            Keep going and you will survive it<br>
            DGD always stay united<br>
            [Bridge: Tilian]<br>
            When it comes and goes<br>
            We stay composed<br>
            And we don't ever wanna talk about it<br>
            When we're on the ropes<br>
            We blow out shows<br>
            And you can try and stop me<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Banking on the fragments of my shadow (Of my shadow)<br>
            Dropping off excuses on the wall<br><br>
            
            [Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Thank God I know the road back home<br>
            You're a battered thief in the night<br>
            At best you're a parasite (Oh-oh)<br>
            Thank God I know the road back home<br>
            (Everybody come 'cause the Lord got in me)<br>
            (Put me on the board of the soul shine company)<br>
            You're an outed spook with a knife<br>
            (Everybody poor 'til the heart start opening up)<br>
            Go ahead, wallow in your spite<br>
            (Never am I bored since the Lord got into me)<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br><br>
            
            [Outro: Andrew Wells]<br>
            The pain never stops<br>
            And the world is unforgiving<br>
            But I still wish you were here<br>
            To watch it burn with me<br>
            I'll never forget our days in Tokyo, Japan<br>
            Those were the best times I ever had<br>
            And we'll carry on for however long<br>
            Walk the path that you told me<br>
            To feel your embrace<br>
            I know I'll see you again<br>
            You're a part of me always<br></p>
