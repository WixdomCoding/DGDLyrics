                    <p>
                        [Verse 1: Jon Mess]<br>
                        I'm drowning in blue light<br>
                        It's a new knife<br>
                        In a three-legged pant<br>
                        I have no qualities so don't talk to me<br>
                        I'm in love with that plant<br>
                        Now I can be too nice<br>
                        I could do right<br>
                        I can bust out a rant<br>
                        I still hate the game<br>
                        But I'll say the name<br>
                        It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br>
                        It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br>
                        It's Dance Gavin Dance (Ha-ha!)<br><br>
                        
                        [Refrain: Tilian, Andrew Wells]<br>
                        Putting all your faith in lies<br>
                        I've been facing endless trials<br>
                        Numbered all your days in kind<br>
                        Days in kind<br><br>
                        
                        [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
                        Try and stop me<br>
                        Banking on the fragments of my shadow (Of my shadow)<br>
                        Dropping off excuses on the way<br>

                        [Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
                        Thank God I know the road back home<br>
                        You're a battered thief in the night<br>
                        At best you'rе a parasite (Oh-oh)<br>
                        Thank God I know the road back home<br>
                        (Evеrybody come 'cause the Lord got in me)<br>
                        (Put me on the board of the soul shine company)<br>
                        You're an outed spook with a knife<br>
                        (Everybody poor 'til the heart start opening up)<br>
                        Go ahead, wallow in your spite<br>
                        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br><br>
                        
                        [Verse 2: Jon Mess]<br>
                        Let's clap for healing and feeling<br>
                        Alleviate pain<br>
                        I'm looking in the truth of it<br>
                        The root of it<br>
                        Stop dragging my wings<br>
                        I fear I'm not enough or I'm too much<br>
                        Keep scrubbing that stain<br>
                        I'm responsible, it's possible<br>
                        Let it process and drain<br><br>
                        
                        [Verse 3: Will Swan]<br>
                        What about that Skywalker OG<br>
                        JP3, Alan?<br>
                        Put bass down, I'll write around it<br>
                        That trust just comes with the talent<br>
                        Some things you can't replace<br>
                        Hurt yourself if you even try it<br>
                        Keep going and you will survive it<br>
                        DGD always stay united<br>
                        [Bridge: Tilian]<br>
                        When it comes and goes<br>
                        We stay composed<br>
                        And we don't ever wanna talk about it<br>
                        When we're on the ropes<br>
                        We blow out shows<br>
                        And you can try and stop me<br><br>
                        
                        [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
                        Banking on the fragments of my shadow (Of my shadow)<br>
                        Dropping off excuses on the wall<br><br>
                        
                        [Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
                        Thank God I know the road back home<br>
                        You're a battered thief in the night<br>
                        At best you're a parasite (Oh-oh)<br>
                        Thank God I know the road back home<br>
                        (Everybody come 'cause the Lord got in me)<br>
                        (Put me on the board of the soul shine company)<br>
                        You're an outed spook with a knife<br>
                        (Everybody poor 'til the heart start opening up)<br>
                        Go ahead, wallow in your spite<br>
                        (Never am I bored since the Lord got into me)<br>
                        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br><br>
                        
                        [Outro: Andrew Wells]<br>
                        The pain never stops<br>
                        And the world is unforgiving<br>
                        But I still wish you were here<br>
                        To watch it burn with me<br>
                        I'll never forget our days in Tokyo, Japan<br>
                        Those were the best times I ever had<br>
                        And we'll carry on for however long<br>
                        Walk the path that you told me<br>
                        To feel your embrace<br>
                        I know I'll see you again<br>
                        You're a part of me always<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Ghost of Billy Royalton</h2>
                    <h3>Produced by Kris Crummett, Stephen Hawkes & Zach Jones</h3>
                    <h4>About the Song:</h4>
                    <p>“The Ghost of Billy Royalton” serves as an ode to Dance Gavin Dance’s long-time bassist, Tim Feerick, who unfortunately passed away on April 13, 2022.<br><br>

                        Feerick started out as a touring bassist for the band in 2009, but officially became a member in November 2012 and appeared on all releases from 2013 to 2022.<br><br>
                        
                        Tim was dear to both the band and fans, who reunited in the Afterburner mural in Sacramento and lit up candles in his honor while playing DGD songs. Tilian joined one of the fans' live streams and stayed grieving with fans.<br><br>
                        
                        This song serves as a memory to Tim and contains explicit messages from the band members to him. Most notably, the outro from Andrew Wells captures his grief while band veterans Jon Mess and Will Swan keep the spirit of Dance Gavin Dance alive.</p>
