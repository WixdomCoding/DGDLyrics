                    <p>
            [Intro: Jon Mess]<br>
            No frowns around<br>
            I'm now an older clown<br>
            I think I honked my spleen<br>
            The money came to answer my prayers<br>
            If you're filming me piss<br>
            It's probably best I stop the stream<br>
            My colon is golden, eyes, they gleam<br><br>

            [Verse 1: Tilian]<br>
            Waking up<br>
            Courage in my cup<br>
            Last night was rough<br>
            Don't remember much<br>
            Waking up<br>
            Courage in my cup<br>
            Last night was rough<br>
            Doing what I love<br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Running on fumes, what can I do?<br>
            Waiting for my score to come through<br>
            Desperate for some motivation<br>
            Running on fumes, checking my views<br>
            Scrolling for a comment that proves<br>
            I don't need more motivation<br><br>

            [Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian]<br>
            I'm locked in, I'm stocked up often<br>
            I'm shopping, my face is frosted<br>
            I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br>
            I'm spilling cups and then I'm fucking the fed<br>
            I'm locked in and topped up often<br>
            No caution, my pace is toxic<br>
            I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br>
            Open and shut, you know I gave it my best<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Rob Damiani]<br>
            Was feeling panicked, so I got myself a knife<br>
            Then I felt empty, so I went and got myself a wife<br>
            I tried to learn about the meaning of my life<br>
            But I couldn't quite decide which good book to buy<br><br>

            [Breakdown: Jon Mess]<br>
            'Cause I'm like that<br>
            Priceless, finest, ice white platypus<br>
            Blessing the things that I touch<br>
            Worship me, worship my stuff<br>
            Fitted with a gimmick, make a cynical wow<br>
            Many men went in it, but they couldn't get out<br>
            All of the things that we touch<br>
            Suck all the life out of us<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            Running on fumes, what can I do?<br>
            Waiting for my score to come through<br>
            Desperate for some motivation<br>
            Running on fumes, checking my views<br>
            Scrolling for a comment that proves<br>
            I don't need more motivation<br><br>

            [Chorus: Jon Mess, Jon Mess & Rob Damiani, Tilian & Rob Diamiani]<br>
            I'm locked in, I'm stocked up often<br>
            I'm shopping, my face is frosted<br>
            I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br>
            I'm spilling cups and then I'm fucking the fed<br>
            I'm locked in and topped up often<br>
            No caution, my pace is toxic<br>
            I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Tilian & Rob Damiani]<br>
            I'm living life, I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br>
            I'm living life, I'm living life as if I'm already dead<br><br>

            [Outro: Jon Mess]<br>
            Hole in the world, holding some pearls<br>
            Making it tough 'cause I'm never enough<br>
            Hole in the earth, sleep on my perch<br>
            Take some time off to forget what you're worth<br>
            Never
