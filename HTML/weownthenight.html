            [Intro: Tilian]<br>
            Forget my jealousy<br>
            You swallowed the demons on your own<br>
            There's nothing left for me<br>
            I keep thinking back to when you said<br>
            "We own the night"<br><br>

            [Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian]<br>
            Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant<br>
            Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid<br>
            Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting<br>
            Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)<br>
            Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though<br>
            Just fake it through the day and the night is your God<br>
            See you in battle, your boat is my paddle<br>
            Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall<br><br>

            [Verse 1: Tilian]<br>
            Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it<br>
            Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living<br>
            Roller coaster, up and down in random motion<br>
            Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming<br>
            Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down<br>
            Give into the moment and live now, live now<br>
            Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down<br>
            Give into the moment, feel it now<br><br>
           
            [Refrain: Tilian]<br>
            I have the heart of a coward<br>
            Here in my arms is exactly where I want you<br>
            We own the night<br><br>

            [Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian]<br>
            Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant<br>
            Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid<br>
            Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting<br>
            Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)<br>
            Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though<br>
            Just fake it through the day and the night is your God<br>
            See you in battle, your boat is my paddle<br>
            Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall<br>
            You'll forget I'm wrong<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Tilian]<br>
            Call your phone and open up my fate<br>
            'Cause I know you're so connected<br>
            I need poison, mitigate my pain<br>
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br>
            Feel my toes go golden up in flames<br>
            Give me false hope in my veins<br>
            Tranquilize and modify my brain<br>
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br><br>

            [Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess]<br>
            Where did I go wrong?<br>
            There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone<br>
            (Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow)<br>
            So I play these nervous songs<br>
            Pretend that I'm not barely hanging on<br>
            (Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow)<br>
            And medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long<br>
            Medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long<br>
            (Do it again, do it again, do it again now)<br><br>

            [Outro: Jon Mess]<br>
            I run quickly out of air<br>
            By the way, I hate your celebration<br>
            I run quickly out of air<br>
            By the way, I hate our aging faces<br>
