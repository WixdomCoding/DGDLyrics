            [Verse 1: Tilian]<br>
            Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now<br>
            Never thought this would hit me so hard<br>
            Staring at my hollow phone, not sure if you're coming home<br>
            Bed still smells like I'm not all alone again<br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I know we fucked it all up this time<br>
            We got so high<br>
            (Couldn't see the bottom)<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I just crashed my car<br>
            And it got me thinking of you<br>
            So I just thought I'd call<br>
            To tell you<br>
            (To tell you I)<br>
            To tell you I still love you<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]<br>
            My mental image impaired, undid the braids in my hair<br>
            I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels<br>
            Remove the tricks of the trade, you're just alone on the stage<br>
            There's no witness, fly your soul through the windshield<br><br>

            [Verse 2: Tilian]<br>
            Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now<br>
            Never thought I could hurt you so hard<br>
            Staring at my hollow phone, wondering if you've found your home<br>
            Feel like I deserve to die alone again<br><br>
           
            [Pre-Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            We really fucked it all up this time<br>
            We got so low<br>
            (Only for a second)<br><br>

            [Chorus: Tilian]<br>
            I just crashed my car<br>
            And it got me thinking of you<br>
            So I just thought I'd call<br>
            To tell you<br>
            (To tell you I)<br>
            To tell you I still love you<br><br>

            [Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]<br>
            Take a sip from the drain, the flavor tastes like nothing<br>
            Or nothing tastes the same 'cause nothing is never there<br>
            I know what I'm talking 'bout, believe the words in my mouth<br>
            'Cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor<br><br>

            [Outro: Jon Mess, Tilian]<br>
            (You know that I won't stop, I'm coming back on top)<br>
            In my heart and in my mind's eye, in my soul<br>
            I know that they ain't never gonna break me<br>
            (Don't call that it's a flop, I got the refs on lock)<br>
            (You know that I won't stop, I'm coming back on top)<br>
            In my heart and in my mind's eye, in my soul<br>
            I know that they ain't never gonna break me<br>
            (Don't call that it's a flop, I got the refs on lock)<br>
            (Damaged pride and vulnerable)<br>
            (You know that I won't stop, I'm coming back on top)<br>
            In my heart and in my mind's eye, in my soul<br>
            I know that they ain't never gonna break me<br>
            (Don't call that it's a flop, I got the refs on lock)<br>
            (All my fears are open now)<br>
            In my heart and in my mind's eye, in my soul<br>
            I know that they ain't never gonna break me<br>
            (You know that I won't stop)<br>
